# **Sanrakshan – Judicial Chatbot Project**
### *Conversational AI for Legal Assistance*
In today’s complex legal landscape, many individuals struggle to navigate the judiciary
system due to a lack of legal knowledge, expensive legal services, and the intricate nature
of legal language. The proposed AI-driven legal assistant, Sanrakshan, is designed to
democratize access to justice by simplifying legal processes, providing multilingual
support, and ensuring transparency in legal proceedings.
Sanrakshan functions as an AI-powered virtual legal assistant capable of understanding
user queries, analysing legal documents, and providing preliminary legal advice based on
relevant laws and precedents. It assists individuals by identifying legal issues, suggesting
possible courses of action, and offering guidance in a language they understand. This
eliminates the need for costly legal consultations and empowers individuals to protect their
rights more effectively.
The system integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning
(ML) models to interpret user queries, classify legal documents, and extract essential legal
insights. Additionally, it incorporates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for
document processing, sentiment analysis for understanding the emotional tone of legal
discussions, and transformer-based AI models for accurate interpretation of legal texts.
